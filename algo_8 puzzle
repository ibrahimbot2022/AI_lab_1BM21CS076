Algorithm for Solving 8-Puzzle Using BFS:
Define the Puzzle Representation:

Represent the puzzle state as a 3x3 matrix/grid.
Define the initial and goal states.
Create a Function to Generate Possible Moves:

Define a function that generates all possible valid moves from a given state. This function will swap the empty tile (0) with its neighboring tiles (up, down, left, right).
Implement BFS Algorithm:

Initialize a queue to store states and their respective paths.
Start with the initial state and enqueue it into the queue.
While the queue is not empty:
Dequeue a state from the front of the queue.
Check if this state is the goal state. If yes, return the path to reach this state.
Generate all possible moves from the current state.
For each valid move:
If the resulting state is not already visited:
Enqueue this state into the queue along with the path to reach it.
Mark this state as visited.
Track Visited States:

Maintain a set or dictionary to track visited states to avoid revisiting them.
Output the Solution:

If a solution is found, return the path to reach the goal state.
If no solution is found after exploring all possible states, return no solution exists.
Display or Output the Steps:

Display the sequence of states along with the moves taken to reach the goal state.
This algorithm utilizes BFS to systematically explore the states of the puzzle, finding the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state.

Implementing this algorithm in code involves defining functions for generating moves, performing BFS search, and displaying the steps, as shown in the previous code examples.
